# Screeps

##Introduction:
This repository is to hold all of my Screeps related files.  Screeps is an AI Scripting MMO Game aimed at programmers.  
You can find the main website for the game at [screeps.com](https://screeps.com/).


###Useful Notes for Working Locally:
You can make screeps find files anywhere on your system by making a symlink. 

To  do this on windows first:

1) Open cmd as an administrator
2) Find the CLASSPATH to the screep local files by going ingame and on the bottom left click `Open local folder`
3) Type in the following:
`mklink /d "CLASSPATH_TO_SCREEPS_LOCAL_FOLDER" "CLASSPATH_TO_WHERE_YOU'RE_WORKING`


Now screeps should pick up your directory
